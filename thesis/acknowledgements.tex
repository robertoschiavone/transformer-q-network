\section{Acknowledgements}

First of all, my thanks go to professor Vincent François-Lavet for his feedback and inputs during the trajectory of this paper and for having given me the opportunity to have a glimpse of what \acrshort{rl} research looks like; I look forward to contribute much, much more to the field. Then, in no particular order, I want to thank my whole family, my girlfriend Salomé for her unwavering love and support, and for her invaluable proof-reading skills, our cat Giulietta, who actually wrote all the code for this paper during feverish pair-programming sessions, my mother Maddalena, my father Girolamo and my sister Deborah for always being there.
